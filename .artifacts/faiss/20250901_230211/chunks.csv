And it's one of the most important players in the world. Over just the last four quarters, its software has facilitated more than $270 billion in gross merchandise volume -- the dollar value of all transactions combined. That certainly gives Shopify a large slice of the e-commerce software pie. And as competitive as business can be, one would think that Shopify has ascended with a ruthless push to get ahead of its rivals. But in reality, the company has a long history of seeking out partnerships whenever possible, even if it's with direct competitors. It's somewhat counterintuitive. But Shopify's management believes that the best way to grow its business is by offering its customers as many options as possible. And to offer more options than it could on its own, it finds ways to partner. This collaborative spirit is still thriving at Shopify. Here are three partnerships the company has forged just in recent months. Roblox ( RBLX 6.13% ) is a video game platform, but not like the games I grew up with in the 1980s. Rather, games tend to be more interactive, social experiences. And with nearly 90 million daily active users, it's certainly popular. What's fascinating with Roblox's business model is that games are created by third-party developers. Roblox is free to play. But certain game elements can be purchased for its in-game currency, providing an opportunity for developers to make some money. Now Roblox is upping the opportunities for its developer community by partnering with Shopify. Just announced in September and launching in 2025, developers will be able to sell physical products with integrations to Shopify. For Shopify, this is really a no-brainer partnership. Roblox isn't a competitor at all. But it still will provide a new use case and a potentially expanded audience for the e-commerce player. In 2006, tech giant Alphabet ( GOOG 1.29% ) ( GOOGL 1.17% ) -- then Google -- acquired upstart video-sharing platform YouTube ."

But now Shopify Plus and Advanced merchants can become YouTube affiliates, making it easier for content creators to highlight products. Shopify Plus is one of the subscription tiers that Shopify's customers can select. And these customers will certainly appreciate the ability to better get in front of YouTube's audience. The integration between video and commerce is a secular trend that's picking up steam. And it's not surprising to see Shopify getting on the right side of the trend. Roblox isn't close to being a Shopify competitor. YouTube has its own commerce arm so it's a little closer of a rival. But financial technology (fintech) pioneer PayPal ( PYPL -0.52% ) is much more of a direct competitor to Shopify considering both companies have merchant customers and both process payments.

Shopify divides its business into two main parts: subscription services and merchant services. Merchant services is the larger business of the two, with Shopify Payments comprising a major part. With its expanded partnership, branded PayPal checkout will be an additional option in the Shopify checkout process.

The good part is that the technology giant's parabolic run is likely to continue after Aug. 27, when it it releases its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 27). Let's look at the reasons that could give Nvidia's stunning rally a shot in the arm after it releases its quarterly results later this month. Image source: Getty Images. When Nvidia released its fiscal Q1 results almost three months ago, the company called for $45 billion in revenue for the recently concluded quarter. That would translate into a 50% jump from the year-ago period. However, management remarked that its guidance ""reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion due to the recent export control limitations.""
The H20 is a China-specific artificial intelligence (AI) data center graphics processing unit (GPU) that was developed by Nvidia to remain in line with the export restrictions imposed by the U.S. on shipments of its chips to China. However, the U.S. government told Nvidia in April that it needs a license to ship its H20 chips to China. As a result, Nvidia lost $2.5 billion worth of sales in fiscal Q1, apart from incurring a $4.5 billion charge owing to the restrictions. The U.S. government has now granted Nvidia the license to export its H20 chips to China on the condition that the company will have to share 15% of its revenue from the sales of this chip with the government. Given that Nvidia was expecting to sell $8 billion of chips to Chinese customers in fiscal Q2, there is a good chance that it may have been able to recoup some of that lost revenue. As a result, Nvidia's guidance for the current quarter could exceed expectations. Its results for the previous quarter could also be better than expected considering the company started applying for export licenses on July 15, a couple of weeks before the quarter ended."

Its results for the previous quarter could also be better than expected considering the company started applying for export licenses on July 15, a couple of weeks before the quarter ended. Of course, there are reports suggesting that Nvidia is facing security-related concerns in China, but investors should note that the shortage of AI-focused GPUs in that market could ensure that the H20 remains in good demand. Moreover, Nvidia is likely to benefit from the stronger-than-expected investments by major cloud computing companies in the U.S. The likes of Amazon , Microsoft , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet are on track to spend $364 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, up from the earlier estimate of $325 billion. That would be an increase of 64% from last year, and an acceleration of 5 percentage points from the capex increase witnessed in 2024. This bodes well for Nvidia, given that it has been maintaining its position as the dominant player in the AI chip market, while rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices are not gaining enough traction yet . Specifically, Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI chip market. As such, the higher spending by big tech companies in the U.S., the renewed growth potential in China, and Nvidia's role in the growth of sovereign AI infrastructure can help the company deliver solid results and guidance on Aug. 27. Nvidia stock has shot up at a parabolic pace in the past four months or so. This explains why it is now trading at 58 times earnings, a big premium to the S&P 500 index's earnings multiple of 25. Investors, however, should note that the company's bottom line is expected to jump by 47% year over year in fiscal Q2, which is more than 5 times the average increase the S&P 500 companies are expected to deliver. So, Nvidia is deserving of its rich valuation thanks to its ability to grow its sales and earnings at a much faster pace than the broader market. That's why investors looking to buy a growth stock can still consider accumulating Nvidia before its upcoming report, as the points discussed above suggest it has the potential to fly higher after Aug. 27."

Stocks are pointing to a higher open on Friday, recovering slightly from yesterday’s losses, as investors look ahead to Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium for clues on the future path for rates. His speech comes amid signs of a weakening labour market and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the impact of trade tariffs on inflation. Powell’s speech will play a pivotal role in shaping the rate cut expectations for September. A dovish stance could see stocks rebound higher and the USD give up this week’s gains. However, should Powell suggest that the Fed is prepared to wait longer due to concerns over rising inflation, US stocks could fall sharply. Currently, the market is pricing in a 73% chance for a 25 basis point rate reduction at the September meeting, down from 90% just a week ago. Investors had increased right but expectations following weak non-farm payroll data, although sticky PPI data saw pricing of expectations. S&P 500 has booked a fifth straight loss on Thursday amid a rotation out of tech stocks into value. The Nasdaq also closed lower for a fifth day.

Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM ) is rising 5% after the communication company posted strong Q2 results and boosted its full-year revenue forecast, with continued expansion of its enterprise business. The S&P 500 has eased back from its record high of 6485, testing its rising trendline support. Should buyers defend this support a recovery above 6400 and towards 6485 could be on the cards. A break below the trendline could open the door to a deeper decline towards 6300 and 6225, the August low. Below here the 6200 comes into play. The USD is rising, putting gains across the week at 0.9% as traders rein in Fed rate cut expectations ahead of Powell’s speech shortly. The EUR/USD is falling for a second straight session after German GDP contracted at a steeper pace in Q2, dropping back into recessionary territory. Q2 GDP was downwardly revised to -0.3% a deeper contraction than initially feared, as exports and investments dropped. The GBP/USD is unchanged at 1.34 but is down 1% this week"

My broader view on the S&P500 (SPX) is that we are coming to the conclusion of a rally, which can represent a major long-term top in the United States equity market. This would conclude an almost 100-year bull market which began at the bottom of the market crash of 1929. In fact, this could usher in a bear market that would rival the one seen in Japan, which lasted for well over a decade. Not only has this market has done a phenomenal job of convincing investors that such a scenario is impossible, but it has attracted new investors with thoughts of constant profits since the market has ""always come back” in a Pavlovian manner. This will likely be a bane to the average investor once the bear market begins. French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr seems to be the first person quoted (in 1849) as proclaiming that “the more things change, the more they stay the same.” As I am sure many understand, he was providing insight into the fact that, while events and circumstances may seem to change in our “modern” era, the underlying driver of human sentiment does not. This truly encapsulates how our financial markets work. Currently, we are hearing how “this time is different” again. Most analysts are pointing towards AI as the reason for this newly found and ubiquitous confidence in the stock market. But, anyone who has traded or invested in the stock market for more than a decade or two knows quite well how fallacious this perspective to be."

But, anyone who has traded or invested in the stock market for more than a decade or two knows quite well how fallacious this perspective to be. So, while many of these newly minted bulls are certain of this market’s infallibility, on my travels this summer through Europe and the United States, I cannot tell you how many people have told me that their children in their teenage years or their early 20’s have taken up trading, because, as their children have put it, “it is so easy to make money.”
Yet, analysts are really not much different. The only real difference is they try to come up with “reasoning” for what their hearts tell them to do. As Ben Franklin astutely noted, “so convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or to make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.”
So, as I have read a number of missives of late which explain why this market has so much higher to go, many of these analysts seem to be basing their expectations on earnings. So, I am going to take a moment to comment on some of their analysis. One author started with the following premise:
“You see, great investors aren’t focused on the moment. They’re trying to discern what the environment will look like a year down the road.” All this statement did was make me wonder if he truly believed that investors are omniscient or clairvoyant? But, I digress. Let’s get to the heart of their “reasoning.”
Most of these investors claim that companies are beating their earnings estimates this year. And, they go on to explain that, based upon these earnings estimates, the market should be heading to 7000 (or higher) by the end of the year. While it is possible and they may be right about the market having much further to go, I do not think it is probable. Nor do I think that following earnings in a linear manner is an appropriate way to prognosticate the stock market. First, anyone who has been involved in markets long enough knows quite well that the earnings season is nothing more than a game."

First, anyone who has been involved in markets long enough knows quite well that the earnings season is nothing more than a game. Analysts will often lower expectations right before earnings so that the reported earnings can easily beat those expectations. Second, I do not believe utilizing earnings in a linear fashion to project stock market targets, as is done by most analysts, is an accurate manner to prognosticate the market, especially at the major turns. While I know many of you may not want to read that full article, I do want to quote certain pertinent items to drive home my point. Finance professor Robert Olson published an article in 1996 in the Financial Analysts Journal in which he presented the conclusions of his study of 4000 corporate earnings estimates by company analysts:
“Experts’ earnings predictions exhibit positive bias and disappointing accuracy. These shortcomings are usually attributed to some combination of incomplete knowledge, incompetence, and/or misrepresentation. This article suggests that the human desire for consensus leads to herding behavior among earnings forecasters.”
In Daniel Crosby’s book The Behavioral Investor, he noted the following:
“Contrarian investor David Dreman found that most (59%) of Wall Street consensus forecasts miss their targets by gaps so large as to make the results unusable – either undershooting or overshooting the actual number by more than 15%. Further analysis by Dreman found that from 1973-1993, the nearly 80,000 estimates he looked at had a mere 1 in 170 chance of being within 5% of the actual number. ""James Montier sheds some light on the difficulty of forecasting in his “Little Book of Behavioral Investing.” In 2000, the average target price of stocks was 37% above market price and they ended up 16%. In 2008, the average forecast was a 28% increase and the market fell 40%. Between 2000 and 2008, analysts failed to even get the direction right in four out of the nine years. ""Finally, Michael Sandretto of Harvard and Sudhir Milkrishnamurthi of MIT looked at the one-year forecasts of 1000 companies covered most widely by analysts."

""Finally, Michael Sandretto of Harvard and Sudhir Milkrishnamurthi of MIT looked at the one-year forecasts of 1000 companies covered most widely by analysts. They found that analysts were consistently inconsistent, missing the market by an annual rate of 31.3% on average.”
So, considering the game that analysts play each earnings season, as well as the facts brought to light by these various studies (and, yes, there are many more such studies), do we really believe that projecting earnings linearly into the future is going to “discern what the environment will look like a year down the road?”
I think not. So, again, while these analysts may be right that we rally into the end of the year in a linear fashion to 7000 or higher, I do not believe this to be probable. Nor do I believe that this time is different. Human nature has not changed in a millennia, and it is human nature which drives financial market prices. And, no linear analysis will ever be able to determine when human nature will decide to change direction, as linear analysis only presupposes that the current trend continues unabated. How did that work out in 2007 or in early 2020? While the market has certainly exceeded my expectations based upon the standards we apply, I will not attempt to justify it based upon reasoning. And, why would I? If the market is driven by emotion, why would I attempt to reason within an emotional environment? This is akin to attempting to reason with your spouse while they are being emotional. How well does that work for you? Rather, when I see a market that has not seen more than a .236 retracement since mid-April, it tells"

Rather, I am viewing this market rally with a healthy dose of concern, as the much longer-term pattern off not just the 2008 low, but off the 1931 low seems to be coming to a conclusion. Therefore, I will continue to approach the market with that healthy dose of concern and caution in all my analysis, as well as a large cash position in my own accounts.
